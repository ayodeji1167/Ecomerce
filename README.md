# ShoppingCart - An amazing website 


I developed an  **Ecommerce REST API Application using Spring Boot** with multiple
modules


### Functionalities:

1. User Registeration.

2. **CRUD Operations for Category, Company, and Product**

* User can add , delete Items to their cart
* Users can reduce the uantity of a particular item in the cart 


3. **Spring Security**

* Method Levle Security
* Any request can hit the registration endpoint
* Different endpoint for USER and ADMIN registration
* Only ADMIN can edit COMPANY, PRODUCT, CATEGORY AND USER.



4 **Check Out**
* After adding products the cart the User can checkout .
* After Checking Out, all checked - out products will be saved to DB as (ORDERED PRODUCTS)
* Confirming Shipping and Billing Address.
